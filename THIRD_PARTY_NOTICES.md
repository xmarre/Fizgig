## ai-toolkit (Ostris, LLC) — MIT License

Upstream: https://github.com/ostris/ai-toolkit

The Krea 2 single-stream MMDiT backbone (`src/fizgig/krea2/model.py`) and the
functional flow-matching sampler (`src/fizgig/krea2/sampling.py`) are ported
from ai-toolkit's `extensions_built_in/diffusion_models/{krea2,flux2}/src`,
then adapted for Fizgig.

## FLUX (Black Forest Labs) — Apache License 2.0

Upstream: https://github.com/black-forest-labs/flux

The Klein 9B DiT (`src/fizgig/klein/model.py`) is a Fizgig-native implementation
based on the FLUX reference model code. Licensed under the Apache License,
Version 2.0. (Model weights are distributed separately under their own license —
see "Note on model weights" below.)

## Diffusers / Qwen-Image VAE — Apache License 2.0

## comfyui-rocm — GNU General Public License v3.0

Upstream: https://github.com/patientx/comfyui-rocm
Copyright the comfyui-rocm authors (patientx and contributors).

comfyui-rocm is a Windows ROCm build of ComfyUI. Fizgig's AMD ROCm Windows
installer uses code from that project as follows:

- `detect_gpu.py` — copied verbatim from comfyui-rocm's `detect_gpu.py`
  (AMD GPU → gfx architecture detection on Windows). **Unmodified.** This file
  is **GPL-3.0 only**; it is not relicensed under Apache-2.0.
- `install_fizgig_rocm.bat` — Fizgig-authored installer that **calls**
  `detect_gpu.py` and follows the same ROCm-wheel install patterns as
  comfyui-rocm's `install.bat` (adapted for Fizgig's venv and
  requirements). The batch file itself is Apache-2.0; the bundled
  `detect_gpu.py` remains GPL-3.0.

`detect_gpu.py` is free software: you may redistribute and/or modify it under
the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software
Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later
version. A copy of the GPL-3.0 text is available at
https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html and in comfyui-rocm's `LICENSE` file.

To receive source for `detect_gpu.py`, use this repository or the upstream
comfyui-rocm repository linked above.

## bitsandbytes Windows ROCm wheel (0xDELUXA) — downloaded at install time

The Windows AMD installer (`install_fizgig_rocm.bat`) downloads a **pinned**
community bitsandbytes wheel from:

https://github.com/0xDELUXA/bitsandbytes_win_rocm

That wheel is **not** built by AMD or Fizgig; it is only fetched on the AMD
install path. Official ROCm PyTorch wheels similarly come from AMD's nightly
index (`https://rocm.nightlies.amd.com/whl-multi-arch/`), also disclosed by the
installer before download.

## Prodigy + Schedule-Free — Apache License 2.0

Upstream: https://github.com/LoganBooker/prodigy-plus-schedule-free

Fizgig optionally uses the `prodigy-plus-schedule-free` Python package for MiniMax H3
LoRA/LoKR and rotation full-finetune optimizer support. The dependency is distributed under
the Apache License, Version 2.0.

## Note on model weights

The third-party notices above cover **source code** only. Krea 2 / FLUX.2 model
weights, the Qwen-Image VAE weights, and the Qwen3-VL text-encoder weights are
distributed by their respective publishers under their own model licenses, which
the user accepts when downloading them. Fizgig does not redistribute any model
weights.
